Question: What is world-space cueing in VR?

Answer: World-space cueing is a subtle gaze direction technique that uses 
geometric modulation of the virtual environment to guide user attention. It 
manipulates spatial properties of objects in the scene to draw the user's 
gaze toward targets of interest while maintaining immersion.
